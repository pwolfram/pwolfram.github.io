## What You Will Do

The COSIM team seeks applications from diverse candidates with expertise in
coastal, ocean and/or land modeling to work on coastal ocean modeling
development, which may include processes such as inundation, sediment transport
and vegetation, tides, and mixing. We particularly welcome research proposals
for development of novel coastal ocean physics, broadly defined but potentially
including but not limited to sub-grid bathymetry approaches, innovative scalar
transport schemes, mixed-dimensional and multiscale modeling, reduced-order
modeling, coupled land-ocean approaches, etc. The successful candidate will be
part of a multidisciplinary team developing an innovative decadal-scale coastal
model for real-world application. Results from this work will be presented in
conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. The initial appointment is
for two years, with a possible third year extension depending on performance
and funding availability.

## What You Need

*Desired Skills:* We seek candidates with diverse research experience with a
preference for individuals with one or more of the following:experience and
knowledge of computational physics, coastal modeling, and/or climate modeling;
experience in construction and application of physical models; programing
expertise; and the analysis and incorporation of data and observations for
model development and testing. The candidate will have also demonstrated
scientific excellence as evidenced by submission and publication of authored
publications in refereed journals, and/or the experience and ability to create
or improve computational software.The ability to work in a highly collaborative
team setting is also a requirement.

*Education:* A Ph.D. in earth sciences, civil engineering, geophysics, fluid
dynamics, climate modeling, computational science, physics, applied
mathematics, or a closely related field. Exceptional candidates with a M.S. and
relevant experience will also be considered.

*Notes to Applicants:* In addition to applying on-line, send a curriculum
vitae, digitized copies of transcripts, names of three references, and a
one-page cover letter detailing qualifications, research interests, and a
proposed research topic (1-3 paragraphs) to Phillip Wolfram
(pwolfram@lanl.gov). Please include “Coastal Ocean Modeling 2018 Postdoc
Search” in the email subject line. Applications will be reviewed as received.
We expect to fill up to 2 postdoc positions by August 2018.

*Additional Details:* Position does not require a security clearance. Selected
candidates will be subject to drug testing and other pre-employment background
checks.

*New-Employment Drug Test:* The Laboratory requires successful applicants to
complete a new-employment drug test and maintains a substance abuse policy that
includes random drug testing.

Candidates may be considered for a Director's Fellowship and outstanding
candidates may be considered for the prestigious Darleane Christian Hoffman,
Richard P. Feynman, J. Robert Oppenheimer, or Frederick Reines Fellowships. For
the named fellowship, the research scope can be broadened to include any topic
of mutual interest in the broad coastal and ocean modeling arena, e.g., global
climate modeling, computational physics and algorithms, high performance
computing in heterogeneous architectures, remote sensing, data analysis, data
assimilation, and machine learning. For general, salary, and benefits
information go to Postdoc Program.

## Equal Opportunity

Los Alamos National Laboratory is an equal opportunity employer and supports a

applyhelp@lanl.gov or call 1-505-665-4444 option 1.

## Where You Will Work

Los Alamos National Laboratory is a multidisciplinary research institution
engaged in science and engineering on behalf of national security. This postdoc
position is within the Climate, Ocean and Sea-Ice Modeling (COSIM) Team that
develops advanced ocean and ice models for the study of climate and climate
change, e.g., the Model for Prediction Across Scales Ocean (MPAS-O) within the
Department of Energy’s Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). Within this
broad activity, a focus is on the role of coastal zone infrastructure
adaptation, ecogeomorphology for regional climate adaptation, the role of ocean
mesoscale eddies in the climate system, and the role of the ocean and ice
systems in the carbon cycle and sea-level rise.

*Location:* Los Alamos, NM, US

*Organization Name:* T-3/Fluid Dynamics And Solid Mechanics

*Job Title:* Postdoc Research Associate for Coastal Ocean Modeling

*Appointment Type:* Postdoc

*Req ID:* IRC61729

        New site construction
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Jan 2018</span>

    <p>This new site is a compilation of several technologies, starting with the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> template. <a href="https://pandoc.org">Pandoc</a> support is enabled to provide references and figure captions via <a href="https://github.com/tomduck/pandoc-fignos">pandoc-fignos</a>.</p>
<h2 id="hyde">Hyde</h2>
<p><a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> is a brazen two-column <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on <a href="http://getpoole.com">Poole</a>, the Jekyll butler.</p>
<h3 id="built-on-poole">Built on Poole</h3>
<p>Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, <a href="/404">404</a>, <a href="/atom.xml">RSS feed</a>, posts, and <a href="/about">example page</a>)</li>
<li>Mobile friendly design and development</li>
<li>Easily scalable text and component sizing with <code>rem</code> units in the CSS</li>
<li>Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements</li>
<li>Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hyde-features">Hyde features</h3>
<p>In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support</li>
<li>Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout">reverse</a> (right sidebar), available via <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes">Eight optional color schemes</a>, available via <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> classes</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme">Head to the readme</a> to learn more.</p>
<h3 id="browser-support">Browser support</h3>
<p>Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.</p>
<h3 id="download">Download</h3>
<p>Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.</p>
<h2 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h2>
<p>This is my new site built on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown">the project's readme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's an immensely useful tool that can be used to produce clean webpages easily.</p>

<h3 id="initial-setup">Initial setup</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>In root directory for site folder, make a copied folder, e.g., <code>cp -r pwolfram.github.io compiled_site</code></li>
<li><code>cd compiled_site</code></li>
<li>Clean it up: <code>rm -r *; git rm -r * -f</code></li>
<li><code>touch .nojekyll</code></li>
<li><code>git add .nojekyll</code></li>
<li><code>git add --all :/</code></li>
<li><code>git commit -m &quot;Built site locally&quot;</code></li>
<li><code>git push origin master:master</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Note, this doesn't keep a copy of the source in the repo!</p>
<h3 id="automating-the-full-process">Automating the full process</h3>
<p>Make a <code>Rakefile</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rake"><code class="sourceCode ruby"><span class="dt">GH_PAGES_DIR</span> = <span class="st">&quot;compiled_site&quot;</span>

desc <span class="st">&quot;Build Jekyll site and copy files&quot;</span>
