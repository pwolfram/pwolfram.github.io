title: About
---

I am a computational fluid dynamist in the Theoretical division Fluid Dynamics
and Solid Mechanics group at Los Alamos National Laboratory with expertise in
numerical methods and modeling of small- and large-scale environmental flows,
ranging from the river junction scale to the global ocean, but with an emphasis
on mixing processes and coastal dynamics ranging from regional to global scales.

My work has centered on understanding mixing processes within complex flows,
most recently for secondary flows in channel networks in the Sacramento San
Joaquin Delta and geostrophic turbulence in idealized Northern Atlantic and
Southern Ocean flows.  I use fluid mechanics, algorithms, high-performance
computing, software engineering, and advanced visualization techniques to
increase knowledge of computation, analysis, and the physics of complex,
eddy-driven mixing processes, with emphasis on coastal and climate
applications.

My interests are in the broad area of development and application of
unstructured computational fluid dynamics, especially nonhydrostatic processes
and in-situ Lagrangian particle tracking techniques. My work uses multiple
methods to understand physical phenomena, including observations, computational
physics, and analysis using a variety of techniques including machine learning.
I am currently working on projects related to
coastal model development, high-performance particle tracking, and analysis for
ocean and coastal modeling and science, especially in high-latitude
environments, e.g., Fig @fig:HighRes.
